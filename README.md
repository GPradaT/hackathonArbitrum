# Lemon hackaton (Arbitrum Sepolia stylus-C smart contract developement)

## What I did

- I created a smart-contract which it can be activated or desactivated by his ownker
- I created some function representations of the C standard library to use it in arbitrus-stylus-c, they have to be well tested to include it on sdk.h
- The smart contract is functional, you can make, check, deploy, and play to see the simple use, read it and with make play but it's not activated yet.
- I couldn't create a frontend.
- I tried to use the storage.h but compiler doesn't let me work with those functions don't knowing why.

## Dificulties

- I couldn't understand how to use VM_HOOKs and the difference of use hostio.h or storage.h from sdk-c
- I couldn't understand really well why are some libraries from js taht are in node-modules that I couldn't use.
- I don't really understand how I have to pass the args parameter when I try to use bool or strings or int params, as I tried to use uint256 and didn't compiles

## What I get from this event

- As is my first time programming smart-contracts I learned a lot of JS as I never used it before.
- Learn how to interact on the blockchain with code.
- Strengthen the knowledgment on C and see more capabilities than I knew.

They are 4 questions to get answered, the 5th first people who answer the 4 questions well will get a prize :D
Ok the code is public but you need to create a frontend to get the prize, so, Up2You if you want the prize <3
